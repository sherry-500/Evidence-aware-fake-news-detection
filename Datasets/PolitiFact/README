PolitiFact Dataset
===================

PolitiFact is a political fact-checking website (www.politifact.com) in which editors 
rate the credibility of claims made by various political figures in US politics. 
We extract all articles from PolitiFact published before December 2017.
Each article includes a claim, the speaker (political figure) who made the claim, 
and the claim’s credibility rating provided by the editors.
PolitiFact assigns each claim to one of six possible ratings:
true, mostly true, half true, mostly false, false and pants-on-fire.

We combine true, mostly true and half true ratings into the class label
true and the rest as false – hence considering only binary credibility labels. 
To retrieve the reporting articles for each claim, we issue each claim as a query 
to a search engine and retrieve the top 30 search results with their respective web sources.


The statistics of the dataset is as following: 
--------------------------------------------------
#Claims				3568 
	#True Claims	1867
	#False Claims	1701
#Claim Sources		95

#Articles			29556
#Article sources	336
---------------------------------------------------

The structure of the politifact.tsv file is following:
<cred_label>\t<claim_id>\t<claim_text>\t<claim_source>\t<evidence>\t<evidence_source>

<cred_label> -- credibility of the claim (True/False)
<claim_id> -- uniq identifier of the claim
<claim_text> -- text of the claim
<claim_source> -- speaker of the claim
<evidence> -- relevant snippet from the evidence article
<evidence_source> -- source of the evidence article
