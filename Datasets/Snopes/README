Snopes Dataset
===================

Snopes is a well-known fact checking website that validates Internet rumors, e-mail forwards, 
hoaxes, urban legends, and other stories of unknown or questionable origin. They typically 
collect these rumors and claims from social media, news websites, e-mails by users, etc. 
Each website article verifies a single claim, e.g., “Clown masks have been banned
in the United States, and wearing one can result in a $50,000 fine." 

The Snopes editors assign a manual credibility verdict to each such claim: True or False. 
Few of the claims have labels like Mostly True or Mostly False. We map Mostly True labels to True,
and Mostly False labels to False — thereby considering only binary credibility labels for this work. 
Claims having labels like Partially True or Partially False are ignored. 

To retrieve the reporting articles for each claim, we issue each claim as a query 
to a search engine and retrieve the top 30 search results with their respective web sources. 


The statistics of the dataset is as following: 
--------------------------------------------------
#Claims				4341 
	#True Claims	1164
	#False Claims	3177
#Claim Sources		-

#Articles			29242
#Article sources	336
---------------------------------------------------

The structure of the politifact.tsv file is following:
<cred_label>\t<claim_id>\t<claim_text>\t<evidence>\t<evidence_source>

<cred_label> -- credibility of the claim (True/False)
<claim_id> -- uniq identifier of the claim
<claim_text> -- text of the claim
<evidence> -- relevant snippet from the evidence article
<evidence_source> -- source of the evidence article
